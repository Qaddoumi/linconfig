# From sway output
Sway requires additional setup for privilege escalation. Without this setup,
sway will fail to start with session activation permission failures. Choose one
of the two available options (In alphabetical, not recommended, order):

1. polkit: This will make sway "just work" right after installation but may be
		   a weightier solution than desired.

2. seatd: Already required as a sway dependency, this is a lighter-weight
		  solution but requires some user configuration: Enabling the service,
		  adding your user to the "seat" group, then logging out/in again.

Either option should provide the same functionality/stability. Refer to the
Sway wiki page for information.
